### Introduction

I have a friend, Andrew. Andrew's school wanted to make a small book of all their graduating students that included their name and photo. The problem is that they have hundreds of students, and making a page for each student would be tedious and repetitive. Andrew approached me with this situation and I developed a script to automate the approach using Keynote (Apple's version of PowerPoint) and AppleScript (Apple's scripting language).

### Concepts Used

* Learning basic AppleScript - I hadn't developed anything serious with it previously.
* Using POSIX file/folder paths.
* Interacting with the Keynote API.
* String manipulation.


### Credits

* [Andrew Abosh](http://andrew-abosh.com/) for the template and images.
