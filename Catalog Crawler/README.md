### Introduction

I used to be heavily into [ROBLOX](https://roblox.com). One feature of the game was an online catalog of virtual items such as shirts, hats, gear, etc. This script will obtain information on every item in the catalog and insert it into a dictionary `items`.

This file is mainly here for historical purposes, so I am unsure if it will work anymore (as of August 20, 2016, it does). This was my first real attempt at web scraping using the BeautifulSoup library in Python.

### Modification

The variable `i` on line 8 can be modified to set at what point in the item database the script should begin crawling. This can be used to skip over sets of items.
