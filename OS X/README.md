### Introduction

I used [BootCamp](https://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/) to install Windows 10 on my Macbook Pro. While working in Windows, I missed several features that OS X had to offer. I wrote this [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) script to port some of them over.

### Features

* All mouse movements are reversed - just like on OS X.
	* Swipe up to move the page down, swipe down to move the page up
	* Swipe left to move right, right to move left
	* You may be familiar with this functionality already on touchscreen devices!

* The Command key will become the CTRL key (so operations such as Command+C will work on OS X _and_ Windows)
* The CTRL key will become the Command key (so pressing Control on the MBP keyboard will open the Start menu)

### Concepts Used

* Learning the AutoHotKey API and language
* Common sense
