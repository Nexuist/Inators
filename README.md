### Introduction

A collection of scripts I have worked on over the years that are too small to deserve their own repositories.

### Naming Scheme

* [♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated ♪](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Heinz_Doofenshmirtz#Running_gags)

### Inators

* Capslockinator - Shows a notification whenever the capslock button is pressed on Windows. Useful for machines that don't have a capslock LED.
* CatalogCrawlinator - Obtains information on items in the ROBLOX catalog.
* Graduationator - Automated slideshow generator for graduating students.
* MJPEG Proxyinator - Proxies MJPEG streams, useful if you don't want to expose (probably insecure) IP cameras to the Internet.
* Nmap IP Dumpinator - Generates a text file with an IP address per line using nmap XML output.
* OS X Spoofinator - Brings OS X style scrolling to Windows.
* iMessage Spaminator - Makes your friends hate you.
